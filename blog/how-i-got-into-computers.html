        <h1>How I Got Into Computers</h1>
        <p>I’ve been fascinated by computers for as long as I can remember. At first, it was pure curiosity — clicking things, breaking things, and trying to understand why something worked or didn’t.</p>
        <p>Over time, that curiosity turned into problem-solving. Fixing errors, tweaking systems, and learning how software interacts with hardware became second nature. Computers stopped being tools and started feeling like systems I could truly understand.</p>
        <p>That early exposure shaped the way I think today. I’m comfortable experimenting, failing, and digging deeper until something makes sense. Computers taught me patience, logic, and the value of learning by doing.</p>
