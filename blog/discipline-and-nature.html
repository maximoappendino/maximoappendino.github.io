        <h1>Discipline, Nature, and the Body</h1>
        <p>Meditation, breath control, and martial arts have always felt deeply connected to me. Practices like kung fu and muay thai aren’t just about combat — they’re about discipline, awareness, and understanding how fragile and powerful the human body truly is.</p>
        <p>Spending time in nature sharpens that awareness even more. Hiking in the mountains without equipment, free diving, and being fully immersed in water or open air strips life down to its essentials: breath, focus, and movement. Every step and every inhale matters.</p>
        <p>There’s something humbling about realizing how deadly techniques can be, and how calm the mind must be to control them. Nature teaches the same lesson — respect it, or it will overwhelm you. Balance is everything.</p>
