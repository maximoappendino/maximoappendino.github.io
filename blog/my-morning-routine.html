        <h1>My Morning Routine</h1>
        <p>Waking up at 5 AM isn't for everyone, but for me, it's a game-changer. The quiet stillness of the early morning provides the perfect environment to focus, plan my day, and get a head start on my goals.</p>
        <p>My routine usually consists of a 30-minute run, followed by meditation and a healthy breakfast. This combination of physical activity and mindfulness helps me start the day with a clear head and a positive attitude.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are days when I'd rather stay in bed, but the benefits of my morning routine far outweigh the temporary discomfort. It's a discipline that has had a profound impact on my productivity and overall well-being.</p>
