        <h1>Games That Shaped Me</h1>
        <p>Arcade games and old consoles were a huge part of my life growing up. From the Game Boy Advance to the PlayStation 2, games felt raw, challenging, and full of personality. Titles like Metal Slug, Castlevania, Kirby, Mortal Kombat, Urban Reign, and Resident Evil 4 left a permanent mark on me.</p>
        <p>Some games weren’t just entertainment — they were worlds. Skyrim was one of those games that made me lose track of time entirely, while arcade machines taught me persistence through difficulty and repetition.</p>
        <p>Modern games still manage to capture that magic sometimes. Outer Wilds and Rain World stand out as experiences that value curiosity, atmosphere, and discovery over hand-holding. They remind me why I fell in love with games in the first place.</p>
